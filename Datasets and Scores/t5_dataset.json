        "wiki_bio_text": "Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 \u2013 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895\u201396, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write \u2013 compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London."

Freddie also has the distinction of being the first ever 350 cc World Champion in 1949 when he won all five events of the inaugural campaign. Frith, alongside other riders from BSA, Ariel and Matchless works teams, served in the army during World War II at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed at Keswick, where officers and NCOs learned how to ride cross-country. Sgt. Freddie Frith taught teams of four on Norton 500s over Skiddaw in all weathers. A special treat on the last day was reserved for roadwork, following Frith's track-style fast cornering."

They started life in the late 1990s at Bartholomew School in Eynsham, with Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (then on guitar) writing songs, then recruiting a drummer and bass player through an ad. They played their first gig in early 1999 and fired the bass player a few months later, with Ben Thomas switching from guitar to bass. By the summer of 2000, Perrier and Thomas' dissatisfaction with their drummer led to his departure, with Thomas switching from bass to drums so the band could continue as a two-piece. Winnebago Deal now consists of two Bens, Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums).\n\nWinnebago Deal generated strong support from many appearances at Oxford's Zodiac Club, eventually supporting Fugazi at London's Forum; this led to their first record, the \"Plata o Plomo\" EP in 2003. They were nominated for the Kerrang Award's \"Best British Newcomer\" that year. Soon after, the band signed a recording contract with Double Dragon Music, and produced their debut album \"Dead Gone\" with Jack Endino, producer of the first Nirvana album \"Bleach\". \"Dead Gone\" was released in September 2004. \"Plata o Plomo\" was reissued in Australia later that year, with an expanded track listing.\n\nThe \"two Bens\" then went on to play as Mondo Generator with Nick Oliveri, former Queens of the Stone Age bassist-vocalist. As well as playing Mondo Generator gigs, they still toured as Winnebago Deal and even supported Mondo Generator, earning them the moniker \"Winnebago Generator\" from fans. After recording tracks at Dave Grohl's Studio 606 for the next Mondo Generator album with producer Nick Raskulinecz, it was announced in July 2006 that they had left the band for \"undisclosed reasons\". In that same month they released their second full-length album \"Flight of the Raven\", with the band again choosing to record with producer Jack Endino. The album features guest appearances from other artists including band partner Nick Oliveri, Endino, Paul Morrill and Edward \"Raven\" Heaton from the band Sicarios, and Rusty Needles of Oxford band Deguello, and was cited as the sixth best album in 2006 by \"Kerrang!\" writer Raziq Rauf.\n\nWinnebago Deal's third full-length album, \"Career Suicide\", was recorded in November 2009 and released a year later."

        "wiki_bio_text": "Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956 in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement. He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990\u201391 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990\u201391, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia. On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia. Alderman's sister Denise Emerson is married to former test umpire Ross Emerson and herself played seven tests for the Australian women's cricket team. Alderman is an alumnus of Aquinas College, Perth."

For \"Gold Medal\", she recorded with her recovering wrists, but could only play for short periods of time. A shoulder problem forced Castellano to withdraw from The Donnas' tour following a show on December 27, 2008, at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA. Amy Cesari of the band The Demonics filled in on future tour dates. On July 9, 2010, Castellano announced on the band's website that due to her shoulder she would have to retire from drumming and performing with The Donnas.

Baird signed for Aberdeen before the Second World War, but the war started before he had made the first team. He joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\". In 1989, he published an autobiography, \"Family of Four\", which described these experiences. Baird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war. His good form in this period earned him selection for Scotland in a friendly match against Belgium in early 1946. Baird was one of nine Scotland players making their international debut in the match, with only Jimmy Delaney having significant experience. Of those nine debutants, five players did not make another international appearance, including Baird. Baird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup (a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup) in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup, but his appearances were restricted by injuries. In all, he made 104 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 26 goals in those matches. He was transferred in 1953 to St. Johnstone, where he played for three seasons before retiring in 1956. After retiring as a player, Baird worked as a teacher and a sports journalist. Baird celebrated his 90th birthday in May 2009, and died quietly in his sleep on 3 November 2009."

His personal name was Xiong L\u00fc, ancestral name Mi (\u8288), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the King of Zhou. King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king, but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride. The king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the state of Yong (\u5eb8\u56fd), a move which made Chu much stronger. After some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the nine tripod cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time, but was rebuffed. In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese four-character idiom of \"Y\u012b M\u01d0ng J\u012bng R\u00e9n\" (\u4e00\u51a5\u800c\u60ca\u4eba)."

This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language. Despite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language-based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal's efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word-by-word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN, are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms. Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads: botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and historical, political, social, and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties, and combinations new to science. Manilal is the founder president of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT)."

Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th. Mackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified for the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th. After the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final. After the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida Gator at the NCAA level for the 2010\u20132011 season, where she became injured but still competed in the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season. Mackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine, scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon."

        "wiki_bio_text": "Twila Shively (March 20, 1920 \u2013 November 25, 1999) was an American competitive baseball player. An outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5'2\", 128 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and she had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva (n\u00e9e Bryant) Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with the headline: \"She's Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\". In 1944, Shively became a member of the Rockola Chicks team of the newly formed National Girls Baseball League. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948\u20131950). In her rookie year, she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season, she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78), hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45), and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers, her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches), and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated from Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana. She also coached the school's softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer's disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality."

Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local high street caf\u00e9. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton to open \"Nutters of Savile Row\" at No. 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, managing director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album \"Abbey Road\" in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims.\n\nIn the 1970s, his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready-to-wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976, Sexton bought Nutter out of the business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the Row with a ready-to-wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at No. 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered 'Miami Vice' look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of the Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film \"Batman\". Nutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS."

Born in Yonkers, New York, Ridzik was signed by the Phillies at the age of 16 and made his Major League debut on September 4, 1950, pitching in relief. In 1951, Ridzik started 12 games and relieved in 30 more, going 9-6 with an earned run average of 3.77. The Phillies traded him on April 30, 1952, along with Smoky Burgess and Stan Palys, to the Cincinnati Redlegs for Andy Seminick, Glen Gorbous, and Jim Greengrass. After having his contract sold to Seattle of the Pacific Coast League that same year, the New York Giants claimed him the next month in the Rule 5 Draft. Ridzik pitched for the Giants from 1952 to 1957, appearing in 56 games including 5 starts. On April 8, 1958, the Giants sold his contract to the Cleveland Indians, where he would pitch in six more games before his contract was sold again to the Chicago Cubs. He would not pitch a Major League game with the Cubs before his contract was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. Ridzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1961 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1964, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career. After life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s. In Florida, he helped with the organizing of charity events featuring former Major League players. He also helped establish the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association with former Senators teammate, Chuck Hinton. He died on January 8, 2008, after fighting heart disease for several years."

        "wiki_bio_text": "C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service."

Nate Saint was born in 1923. When he was seven, he took his first plane ride with his brother Sam, who would eventually become a commercial pilot for American Airlines. While in the airplane, he discovered a love of flying. His family was somewhat unusual; his brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard.\n\nWhen he joined the army, he was stationed in Las Vegas, NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident, he learned to live life to the fullest.\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a settlement of the Huaorani, also known as Aucas, while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane. The Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadoreans, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force; they attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement. Their initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. \"Life\" magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. Rachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint.\n\nIn 1966, Marjorie (Marj) Farris Saint married Abe Van Der Puy, president of HCJB World Radio. Abe died in 2003; and Marj died in 2004, from cancer. She is buried in Hillcrest Memorial Gardens, south of Ocala, Florida. Nate's older son, Steve Saint, spent time as a child visiting his missionary family members and friends and getting to know the Huaorani. Steve was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by Mincaye, who was the very man who killed his father but later converted to Christ. Steve Saint now works with the Huaorani people and travels around the world, preaching the gospel, often accompanied by Mincaye.\n\nA documentary based on the story, \"Through the Gates of Splendor\", was released in 2005. The following year, a feature film, \"End of the Spear\", was released on January 20, a week and a half after the 50-year anniversary of the killings. Steve Saint also helped write \"Jungle Pilot\", based on his father's diary about his time in Ecuador and work with the Huaorani Indians."

During the first twenty-two years of Thutmose's reign, he was co-regent with his stepmother and aunt, Hatshepsut, who was named the pharaoh. While he was shown first on surviving monuments, both were assigned the usual royal names and insignia and neither is given any obvious seniority over the other. He served as the head of her armies. After her death and his later rise to pharaoh of the kingdom, he created the largest empire Egypt had ever seen; no fewer than seventeen campaigns were conducted, and he conquered from Niya in North Syria to the fourth cataract of the Nile in Nubia. Officially, Thutmose III ruled Egypt for almost fifty-four years, and his reign is usually dated from April 24, 1479 BC to March 11, 1425 BC; however, this includes the twenty-two years he was co-regent to Hatshepsut. During the final two years of his reign, he appointed his son and successor, Amenhotep II, as his junior co-regent. His firstborn son and heir to the throne, Amenemhat, predeceased Thutmose III. When Thutmose III died, he was buried in the Valley of the Kings as were the rest of the kings from this period in Egypt."

Loder (7 April 1946 \u2013 12 August 2005) was an English sound engineer, record producer, and founder of Southern Studios, as well as a former member of Exit and co-founder of the Southern Records distribution company with his wife Sue. He was also the studio engineer of choice for Crass Records and was often considered to be the band's \"ninth member\". Loder was born near Plymouth and educated at boarding school before studying electrical engineering at London's City University. During his post-graduate work there, he became involved in early experiments in digital encoding of audio for the military. By 1970, he had joined Exit, alongside Penny Rimbaud, utilizing a one-track tape-recorder. This led to Loder eventually founding a record studio in his garage after the disbanding of Exit in 1974.\n\nLoder was recording advertising jingles in 1977 when his path crossed once again with Rimbaud, who had by then co-founded Crass, and at this point invited Loder to become the band's engineer and financial manager, roles Loder happily accepted. When Crass founded their own record label, Loder worked as an engineer on most of the label's releases, and when Loder saw potential in a number of bands turned away by Crass Records due to ideological differences, he set up Southern Records. Loder engineered and produced for many bands other than Crass, among them The Jesus and Mary Chain, for whom he engineered the recordings of the \"Psychocandy\" album, Big Black's \"Songs About Fucking\", PJ Harvey, Babes in Toyland, Fugazi, Ministry, and Shellac.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Loder established a television production facility at Southern. Its notable output included the music show \"Snub TV\", which after first being syndicated nationwide in the USA, went on to further success on BBC2 and in other countries. Loder was responsible for encouraging and establishing independent alternative internet ezines, donating the use of Southern's servers and bandwidth, taking part in pioneering online media streaming and simulcasting. Loder died of a brain tumour in 2005, aged 59."

Although a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, Holgate had a career in the Gilbertine Order of which he became Master. Most of the Gilbertine houses were lesser establishments which should have been dissolved under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (only four out of twenty-six houses had revenues over \u00a3200 a year). However, Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. For example, Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last of them to surrender in December 1539, whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than \u00a3200 a year, surrendered in 1538.\n\nIn 1550 Holgate married Barbara Wentworth, who was about 25 at the time. This may, however, have been a second marriage to make it fully legal, and Holgate and Wentworth may have first married in late 1547 with Roger Tongue officiating. In 1551 Arthur Norman claimed that he was already married to Barbara Wentworth, but the courts decided that their marriage when she was about seven had not been a binding legal transaction. Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne she imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married clergy being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist.\n\nIn January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year. In 1558 a Robert Holgate from Yorkshire entered the University of Cambridge. He may have been a son of Holgate, since there are some claims he had two children by Barbara, but there is no conclusive evidence on the matter."

He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as \"Lamido Fumbina\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular: Lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of southern Cameroon."

        "wiki_bio_text": "Vitaliano Brancati (July 24, 1907 \u2013 September 25, 1954) was an Italian novelist, dramatist, poet, and screenwriter. Born in Pachino, Syracuse, Brancati studied in Catania, where he graduated in letters and where he spent the majority of his life. Although he began writing at a young age and was already the author of six books at 25 years old, which were largely influenced by fascist ideals and later rejected by Brancati himself, critics tend to set the starting point of his career in 1935, when he released the collection of short stories In Search of a Cause.\n\nBrancati achieved his first and probably most significant success in 1941 with the novel Don Giovanni in Sicily, a vibrant and humorous portrait of the Sicilian temperament. In 1944 he wrote the novel Gli Anni Perduti (The Lost Years), a bold satire of Benito Mussolini's megalomania, and in 1946 Vecchio con gli Stivali (Old Man in Boots), a satirical short story inspired by the vicissitudes of Italian fascism, which won the Vendemmia Award and was adapted into a successful film, Difficult Years, by Luigi Zampa. In 1950 he won the Bagutta Prize with another well-known novel, Il Bell'Antonio (The Handsome Antonio).\n\nHe died in a clinic in Turin after a major surgery. He was married to actress Anna Proclemer."

He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective and the military was strong.

He is often described as \"the father of Norwegian landscape painting\" and is regarded as the first Norwegian painter ever to reach a level of artistic accomplishment comparable to that attained by the greatest European artists of his day. He was also the first to acquire genuine fame and cultural renown abroad. As one critic has put it, \"J.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century.\"\n\nAlthough Dahl spent much of his life outside of Norway, his love for his country is clear in the motifs he chose for his paintings and in his extraordinary efforts on behalf of Norwegian culture generally. Indeed, if one sets aside his own monumental artistic creations, his other activities on behalf of art, history, and culture would still have guaranteed him a place at the very heart of the artistic and cultural history of Norway. He was, for example, a key figure in the founding of the Norwegian National Gallery and of several other major art institutions in Norway, as well as in the preservation of Norwegian stave churches and the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim and H\u00e5konshallen in Bergen."
